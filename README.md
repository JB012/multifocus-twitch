# MultiFocus Twitch
> A web application that allows you to watch multiple Twitch streams and switch between them.

## How It's Made:
Tech Used:
* Twitch API
* React

By taking user input via URL parameters and text input, iframes of the streams and its respective chat are displayed using Twitch API.

## Lessons Learned
I learned the importance of a responsive website. In a website where multiple streams are displayed, it's vital that the size of the streams are updated to the most optimal size so that the users can see as much as they can (ex: window resize, size of 1 stream displayed vs size of 5 streams displayed). I also learned more about state, effect, and ref hooks in React.
